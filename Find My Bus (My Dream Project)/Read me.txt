Hi!

I'm Ragu M, a graduated Mechanical Engineer...
In my college days, I have realized the importance of the public transport buses's schedule...
After my graduation, I'm not interest to work in our field...
I always looking to learn the technologies...
So, I had planned to join a Python course...

By completing the Python class, My long-term dream was fulfilled...
The source code of my project will be available on my GitHub profile...

Thanks to Python...
